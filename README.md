# RFD - Request for Discussion

A Request for Discussion (RFD) is an open format for capturing and refining
system designs, enhancements, and practices. The goal of RFDs
is to create a mechanism that enables open engineering communication while 
simultaneously capturing decisions and considerations.

For additional detail on RFDs, please refer to [RFD-0001](./rfd/0001/index.md).

## List of RFDs

The [RFD Index](./rfd/README.md) contains a full list of RFDs and their states.


## How to Create an RFD

**TODO** - This section will be updated with instructions once RFD-0001 is 
accepted. Until then, please refer to the [draft RFD for instructions](./rfd/0001/index.md).
