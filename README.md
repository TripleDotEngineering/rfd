## How to Create an RFD

### Allocate a new RFD number
RFDs are numbered starting at 1, and should be represented as zero-padded 4-digit 
numbers. Use the `rfd.py` tool, to allocate a new RFD number and generate some 
boiler-plate content from a template. To create a new RFD, run:

```bash
python tools/rfd.py make
```

This will prompt you for some basic information to fill out the initial metadata.
Note, that GitHub username is used to identify the author. This enables us to
more easily link the author URL to the person submitting the pull request.
